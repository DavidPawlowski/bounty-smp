## 🎮 Features

### Bounty System
Players are assigned random bounty targets when they join. Kill your target to increase your bounty level and gain powerful effects (speed, strength, extra hearts, glowing). Get hunted down and lose it all.

### Custom Weapons

| Weapon | Base Item | Mechanic |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **⚡ Charge Bow** | Bow | Hit players 4 times with arrows to charge. Next arrow deals **Power 20** damage. Counter resets after the charged shot. Actionbar progress + sound/particle effects on full charge. |
| **🩸 Vampire Sword** | Iron Sword | Player-only. Every 5th hit on a player deals **+4 HP bonus damage** and **heals you for 4 HP**. Actionbar blood counter + particle/sound effects. |
| **💨 Charged Mace** | Mace | Right-click to launch a Wind Charge projectile. 5-second cooldown. |
| **⚡ Thunder Trident** | Trident | Left-click a player to strike lightning on them. Works in any weather. 5-second cooldown. |
| **🪓 Stun Axe** | Diamond Axe | Right-click to stun the player you're looking at for 1 second (Slowness 255 + Weakness). 10-second cooldown. |

### Recipe Management
Every weapon has a **craftable recipe** that can be changed in-game with commands. The Charge Bow recipe is also **persisted to `config.yml`** and can be hot-reloaded.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Java 21** or later
- **Minecraft Server**: [Paper](https://papermc.io/) 1.21.x (also works on Spigot 1.21.x)
- **Gradle 8.x** (only needed for building — the wrapper handles this)

---

## 🔨 Building from Source

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bounty-smp.git
cd bounty-smp
```

### 2. Generate the Gradle wrapper

> The `gradle-wrapper.jar` is excluded from version control (it's a binary). You need to generate it once:

**If you have Gradle installed:**
```bash
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.5
```

**If you don't have Gradle installed:**
```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install gradle

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install gradle

# Linux (SDKMAN — recommended)
sdk install gradle 8.5

# Then generate the wrapper
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.5
```

### 3. Build the plugin

```bash
# macOS / Linux
chmod +x ./gradlew
./gradlew build

# macOS — if your system Java isn't 21+, point to Homebrew's JDK explicitly:
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk ./gradlew build

# Windows
gradlew.bat build
```

The compiled JAR lands in `build/libs/` named after the version in `gradle.properties` (e.g. `playergamespaperplugin-0.2.0.jar`).

### 4. Install

Copy the compiled JAR to your server:

```bash
cp build/libs/playergamespaperplugin-0.2.0.jar /path/to/your/server/plugins/
```

Restart or reload the server. Done!
